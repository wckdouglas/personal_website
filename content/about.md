I am a Bioinformatics Engineer at Invitae. I previously worked at QIAGEN as a Bioinformatics Scientist. Before joining the biotech world, I was a PhD student developing sequencing assays at the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology in The University of Texas at Austin at the [Lambowitz's lab]("https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/lambowitz"). I worked on RNA-seq and DNA-seq using a novel [reverse transcriptase](http://www.ingex.com/tgirt-kit/). Before making a switch into the genomics world, I was trained as a cell biologist under [Wang's Lab](http://mechanical.illinois.edu/directory/faculty/nwangrw) working on [mechanobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanobiology).

I occasionally push some codes (that I found it useful day-to-day) to [[github]](https://github.com/wckdouglas) and I try to make all the codes that I used in my publications available to the public. If anything that you are looking for is not in any of my public repository, feel free to [[email]](mailto:wckdouglas@gmail.com) or [[tweet]](https://twitter.com/wckdouglas) me.
