So I came across the World University Rankings from Times Higher Education, and play around with their [table](https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2015/world-ranking/#/sorting/research/direction/desc). Some of the schools had high research scores but low citation rank, and *vice versa*. Why would that be the case?

According to their methodoloy section:

* Teaching: the learning environment (worth 30 per cent of the overall ranking score)
* Research: volume, income and reputation (worth 30 per cent)
* Citations: research influence (worth 30 per cent)
* Industry income: innovation (worth 2.5 per cent)
* International outlook: staff, students and research (worth 7.5 per cent).

Are some schools getting too much resources more than what they can produce? and some schools are doing very good research with limited fundings?
