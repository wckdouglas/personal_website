## Motivation
I have a multi-docker [[repo]](https://github.com/wckdouglas/bio-tools) that stores a few containers 
for different tasks/projects. I want to be able to push an updated container to the 
[[github container registry (ghcr.io)]](https://ghcr.io) every time I have a new commit to the repository.

## Requirements:
- Docker images are organized in subfolders [[repo]](https://github.com/wckdouglas/bio-tools)
- Docker-build is run with github action
- Not recreating all containers if I am only making changes changes to only one image

## Github action yaml file

TLDR; the action yaml is at [[here]](https://github.com/wckdouglas/bio-tools/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker.yml)

### Setup workflow

For github actions, we need to define when the action is run. For this wokflow, I want to trigger it for all pull requests and pushes.

And we can also setup some environment variables as well to define the container registry and image name.

```yaml
name: Push and publish to Docker Hub
on: [push, pull_request]

env:
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  IMAGE_NAME_BASE: ${{ github.repository }}
```

### Setup action

And then we can setup variables for the action itself. The highlight is that I'm using `matrix.docker` to define which subfolder in the repo I am going to build docker containers from (each of these subfolder should have a `Dockerfile` file).

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    timeout-minutes: 20
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        docker: ["single_cell", "graph_genome", "biotools", "hla", "assemble"]
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
```

### Steps 

#### standard steps

Some standard github action steps to includes are:
- `actions/checkout@v3`: checking out the repo
- `docker/login-action`: to login to the `ghcr.io` container registry, some more info can be found [[here]](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)

```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Log in to the Container registry
        uses: docker/login-action@f054a8b539a109f9f41c372932f1ae047eff08c9
        with:
          registry: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

#### identifying the new changes

- the [`tj-actions/changed-files`](https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files) helps identifying what files are changed. And we can couple this with the `${{ matrix.docker }}/Dockerfile` variable to determine if there are any changes being made to each docker file.

```yaml
      - name: Get changed files in the ${{ matrix.docker }} folder
        id: changed-files-specific
        uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v34
        with:
          files: |
            ${{ matrix.docker }}/Dockerfile
```

#### Building the docker container

- we can use the standard `docker/build-push-action`, but adding a `if: steps.changed-files-specific.outputs.any_changed == 'true'` to use the above step to identify whether the build step is required for this container:

```yaml

      - name: Build ${{ matrix.docker }}
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        if: steps.changed-files-specific.outputs.any_changed == 'true'
        with:
          context: ./${{ matrix.docker }}
          file: ./${{ matrix.docker }}/Dockerfile
          platforms: linux/amd64
          push: true
          tags: |
            ghcr.io/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME_BASE }}/${{ matrix.docker }}:${{ github.sha }}
            ghcr.io/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME_BASE }}/${{ matrix.docker }}:latest
```
