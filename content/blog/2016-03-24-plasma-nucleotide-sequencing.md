I have been wondering what people do with nucleotide sequencings in blood plasma, so I decided to do a bit of data mining in pubmed database to answer this question. 

I searched pubmed with the key words: 'plasma sequencing', and built a network based on the search results using the words in their titles.


The network is plotted here:
![](/article_images/plasmaSeq/titleWordingNetwork.png)


From the words network, I would say plasma sequencings have been applied on non-invasive screening in pregnancies and cancer patients.

The following is the script that I used to generate the figure.

    for comb in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(wordList,2):

        wordCombCount[comb] += 1
    return wordCombCount
